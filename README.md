# ReactJS Movie Database Course

The site is live [here](https://goofy-bose-8610da.netlify.app/)

This web site is being created to get hands down practice on ReactJS and its components and hooks. For this website the following modules have been used.

- [React Router ](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [Prop-Types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

The main application its on main branch, but a refactor of the code for Typescript reside on app-type

## Usage

The app requires `./my-app/.env` with the variable `REACT_APP_API_KEY=` and the API key from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) without quotation
